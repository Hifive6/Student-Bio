      <p>I am very exvited to be in this program as I need a change in life. 

      
      <p>This prgram gives me the skills and options to find another job. I have been in the same job since 2010, and find that while it is a good job it is also a dead end job with no movement either up or side ways.</p> 
      
      <p>I love to play and watch basketball and the world cup, but not to heavey into soccor. I play video games and my prmiary goal is to someday make a video game.</p>
